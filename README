## Advent of Code

### Start a new challenge

Before starting a day, run the folling command:

```
be ./aoc.rb 2020 3 1
```

This will generate the files structure for that specific day (3 in the example).

### Run specs for a specific day/part

To run specs for a specific day/part run the command again:

```
# To run the program and specs for Day 3, Part 1
be ./aoc.rb 2020 3 1

# To run the program and specs for Day 3, Part 2
be ./aoc.rb 2020 3 2
```

This will also print the solution if specs pass.
